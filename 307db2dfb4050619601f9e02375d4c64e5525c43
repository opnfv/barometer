The Python dependencies are installed for the OpenStack plugins, but the actual plugins aren\u0027t installed.\n\nAlso, I don\u0027t see this image as a base to something else that would be using the repo, and I haven\u0027t seen any scripts that seem to reference the plugins.\n\nSo either 1) this shouldn\u0027t be installed into the image here, and 2) we should expand this section to run a `pip install .` after the deps are installed.\n\nI have a mailing list email out asking about this very section.",
