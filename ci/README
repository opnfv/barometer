If you would like to build the RPMs locally you will need a CentOS7 platform.
Set an environment variable called WORKSPACE to /tmp.
Make sure $PERL_MM_OPT is not set as an environment variable.
Run the following:

  * sudo -E ./install_dependencies.sh
  * sudo -E ./build_rpm.sh
  
 This will create 3 directories in /tmp: collectd, intel-cmt-cat and rpmbuild.
 
 The built RPMs can be found in rpmbuild/RPMS/x86_64/.
