collectd plugins
=================
Barometer has enabled the following collectd plugins:

* dpdkstat plugin: A read plugin that retrieve stats from the DPDK extended
   NIC stats API.

* `ceilometer plugin`_: A write plugin that pushes the retrieved stats to
  Ceilometer. It's capable of pushing any stats read through collectd to
  Ceilometer, not just the DPDK stats.

* hugepages plugin:  A read plugin that retrieves the number of available
  and free hugepages on a platform as well as what is available in terms of
  hugepages per socket.

* RDT plugin: A read plugin that provides the last level cache utilitzation and
  memory bandwidth utilization

* Open vSwitch events Plugin: A read plugin that retrieves events from OVS.

* mcelog plugin: A read plugin that uses mcelog client protocol to check for
  memory Machine Check Exceptions and sends the stats for reported exceptions

All the plugins above are available on the collectd master, except for the
ceilometer plugin as it's a python based plugin and only C plugins are accepted
by the collectd community. The ceilometer plugin lives in the OpenStack
repositories.

Other plugins under development or existing as a pull request into collectd master:

* dpdkevents:  A read plugin that retrieves DPDK link status and DPDK
  forwarding cores liveliness status (DPDK Keep Alive).

* Open vSwitch stats Plugin: A read plugin that retrieve flow and interface
  stats from OVS.

* SNMP write: A write plugin that will act as a SNMP subagent and will map
  collectd metrics to relavent OIDs. Will only support SNMP: get, getnext and
  walk.

* Legacy/IPMI: A read plugin that reports platform thermals, voltages,
  fanspeed, current, flow, power etc. Also, the plugin monitors Intelligent
  Platform Management Interface (IPMI) System Event Log (SEL) and sends the
  collectd notification once a new record appears in the SEL.

Building collectd with the Barometer plugins and installing the dependencies
=============================================================================

All Upstreamed plugins
-----------------------
The plugins that have been merged to the collectd master branch can all be
built and configured through the barometer repository.

**Note**: sudo permissions are required to install collectd.

**Note**: These are instructions for Ubuntu 16.04.

To build and install these dependencies, clone the barometer repo:

.. code:: c

    $ git clone https://gerrit.opnfv.org/gerrit/barometer

Install the build dependencies

.. code:: bash

    $ ./src/install_build_deps.sh

To install collectd as a service and install all it's dependencies:

.. code:: bash

    $ cd barometer/src && sudo make && sudo make install

This will install collectd as a service and the base install directory
is /opt/collectd.

Sample configuration files can be found in '/opt/collectd/etc/collectd.conf.d'

Please note if you are using any Open vSwitch plugins you need to run:

.. code:: bash

    $ sudo ovs-vsctl set-manager ptcp:6640

DPDK statistics plugin
-----------------------
Repo: https://github.com/collectd/collectd

Branch: master

Dependencies: DPDK (http://dpdk.org/)

To build and install DPDK to /usr please see:
https://github.com/collectd/collectd/blob/master/docs/BUILD.dpdkstat.md

Building and installing collectd:

.. code:: bash

    $ git clone https://github.com/collectd/collectd.git
    $ cd collectd
    $ ./build.sh
    $ ./configure --enable-syslog --enable-logfile --enable-debug
    $ make
    $ sudo make install


This will install collectd to /opt/collectd
The collectd configuration file can be found at /opt/collectd/etc
To configure the hugepages plugin you need to modify the configuration file to
include:

.. code:: bash

    LoadPlugin dpdkstat
    <Plugin dpdkstat>
           Coremask "0xf"
           ProcessType "secondary"
           FilePrefix "rte"
           EnabledPortMask 0xffff
    </Plugin>

For more information on the plugin parameters, please see:
https://github.com/collectd/collectd/blob/master/src/collectd.conf.pod

Please note if you are configuring collectd with the **static DPDK library**
you must compile the DPDK library with the -fPIC flag:

.. code:: bash

    $ make EXTRA_CFLAGS=-fPIC

You must also modify the configuration step when building collectd:

.. code:: bash

    $ ./configure CFLAGS=" -lpthread -Wl,--whole-archive -Wl,-ldpdk -Wl,-lm -Wl,-lrt -Wl,-lpcap -Wl,-ldl -Wl,--no-whole-archive"

Please also note that if you are not building and installing DPDK system-wide
you will need to specify the specific paths to the header files and libraries
using LIBDPDK_CPPFLAGS and LIBDPDK_LDFLAGS. You will also need to add the DPDK
library symbols to the shared library path using ldconfig. Note that this
update to the shared library path is not persistant (i.e. it will not survive a
reboot). Pending a merge of https://github.com/collectd/collectd/pull/2073.

.. code:: bash

    $ ./configure LIBDPDK_CPPFLAGS="path to DPDK header files" LIBDPDK_LDFLAGS="path to DPDK libraries"

      Cores ""
    </Plugin>

For more information on the plugin parameters, please see:
https://github.com/collectd/collectd/blob/master/src/collectd.conf.pod

IPMI Plugin
-----------
Repo: https://github.com/maryamtahhan/collectd

Branch: feat_ipmi_events, feat_ipmi_analog

Dependencies: OpenIPMI library

The IPMI plugin is already implemented in the latest collectd and sensors
like temperature, voltage, fanspeed, current are already supported there.
The list of supported IPMI sensors has been extended and sensors like flow,
power are supported now. Also, a System Event Log (SEL) notification feature
has been introduced.

* The feat_ipmi_events branch includes new SEL feature support in collectd
  IPMI plugin. If this feature is enabled, the collectd IPMI plugin will
  dispatch notifications about new events in System Event Log.

* The feat_ipmi_analog branch includes the support of extended IPMI sensors in
  collectd IPMI plugin.

On Ubuntu, install the dependencies:

.. code:: bash

    $ sudo apt-get install libopenipmi-dev

Enable IPMI support in the kernel:

.. code:: bash

    $ sudo modprobe ipmi_devintf
    $ sudo modprobe ipmi_si

**Note**: If HW supports IPMI, the ``/dev/ipmi0`` character device will be
created.

Clone and install the collectd IPMI plugin:

.. code:: bash

    $ git clone  https://github.com/maryamtahhan/collectd
    $ cd collectd
    $ git checkout $BRANCH
    $ ./build.sh
    $ ./configure --enable-syslog --enable-logfile --enable-debug
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

Where $BRANCH is feat_ipmi_events or feat_ipmi_analog.

This will install collectd to default folder ``/opt/collectd``. The collectd
configuration file (``collectd.conf``) can be found at ``/opt/collectd/etc``. To
configure the IPMI plugin you need to modify the file to include:

.. code:: bash

    LoadPlugin ipmi
    <Plugin ipmi>
       SELEnabled true # only feat_ipmi_events branch supports this
    </Plugin>

**Note**: By default, IPMI plugin will read all available analog sensor values,
dispatch the values to collectd and send SEL notifications.

For more information on the IPMI plugin parameters and SEL feature configuration,
please see:

https://github.com/maryamtahhan/collectd/blob/feat_ipmi_events/src/collectd.conf.pod

Extended analog sensors support doesn't require addition configuration. The usual
collectd IPMI documentation can be used.

https://collectd.org/wiki/index.php/Plugin:IPMI

Mcelog Plugin:
--------------
Repo: https://github.com/collectd/collectd

Branch: master

Dependencies: mcelog

Start by installing mcelog. Note: The kernel has to have CONFIG_X86_MCE
enabled. For 32bit kernels you need at least a 2.6,30 kernel.

On ubuntu:

.. code:: bash

    $ apt-get update && apt-get install mcelog

Or build from source

.. code:: bash

    $ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/cpu/mce/mcelog.git
    $ cd mcelog
    $ make
    ... become root ...
    $ make install
    $ cp mcelog.service /etc/systemd/system/
    $ systemctl enable mcelog.service
    $ systemctl start mcelog.service

Verify you got a /dev/mcelog. You can verify the daemon is running completely
by running:

.. code:: bash

     $ mcelog --client

This should query the information in the running daemon. If it prints nothing
that is fine (no errors logged yet). More info @
http://www.mcelog.org/installation.html

Modify the mcelog configuration file "/etc/mcelog/mcelog.conf" to include or
enable:

.. code:: bash

    socket-path = /var/run/mcelog-client

Clone and install the collectd mcelog plugin:

.. code:: bash

    $ git clone  https://github.com/maryamtahhan/collectd
    $ cd collectd
    $ git checkout feat_ras
    $ ./build.sh
    $ ./configure --enable-syslog --enable-logfile --enable-debug
    $ make
    $ sudo make install

This will install collectd to /opt/collectd
The collectd configuration file can be found at /opt/collectd/etc
To configure the mcelog plugin you need to modify the configuration file to
include:

.. code:: bash

    <LoadPlugin mcelog>
      Interval 1
    </LoadPlugin>
    <Plugin "mcelog">
       McelogClientSocket "/var/run/mcelog-client"
    </Plugin>

For more information on the plugin parameters, please see:
https://github.com/maryamtahhan/collectd/blob/feat_ras/src/collectd.conf.pod

Simulating a Machine Check Exception can be done in one of 3 ways:

* Running $make test in the mcelog cloned directory - mcelog test suite
* using mce-inject
* using mce-test

**mcelog test suite:**

It is always a good idea to test an error handling mechanism before it is
really needed. mcelog includes a test suite. The test suite relies on
mce-inject which needs to be installed and in $PATH.

You also need the mce-inject kernel module configured (with
CONFIG_X86_MCE_INJECT=y), compiled, installed and loaded:

.. code:: bash

    $ modprobe mce-inject

Then you can run the mcelog test suite with

.. code:: bash

    $ make test

This will inject different classes of errors and check that the mcelog triggers
runs. There will be some kernel messages about page offlining attempts. The
test will also lose a few pages of memory in your system (not significant)
**Note this test will kill any running mcelog, which needs to be restarted
manually afterwards**.

**mce-inject:**

A utility to inject corrected, uncorrected and fatal machine check exceptions

.. code:: bash

    $ git clone https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/utils/cpu/mce/mce-inject.git
    $ cd mce-inject
    $ make
    $ modprobe mce-inject

Modify the test/corrected script to include the following:

.. code:: bash

    CPU 0 BANK 0
    STATUS 0xcc00008000010090
    ADDR 0x0010FFFFFFF

Inject the error:
.. code:: bash

    $ ./mce-inject < test/corrected

**Note: the uncorrected and fatal scripts under test will cause a platform reset.
Only the fatal script generates the memory errors**. In order to  quickly
emulate uncorrected memory errors and avoid host reboot following test errors
from mce-test  suite can be injected:

.. code:: bash

       $ mce-inject  mce-test/cases/coverage/soft-inj/recoverable_ucr/data/srao_mem_scrub

**mce-test:**

In addition an more in-depth test of the Linux kernel machine check facilities
can be done with the mce-test test suite. mce-test supports testing uncorrected
error handling, real error injection, handling of different soft offlining
cases, and other tests.

**Corrected memory error injection:**

To inject corrected memory errors:

* Remove sb_edac and edac_core kernel modules: rmmod sb_edac rmmod edac_core
* Insert einj module: modprobe einj param_extension=1
* Inject an error by specifying details (last command should be repeated at least two times):

.. code:: bash

    $ APEI_IF=/sys/kernel/debug/apei/einj
    $ echo 0x8 > $APEI_IF/error_type
    $ echo 0x01f5591000 > $APEI_IF/param1
    $ echo 0xfffffffffffff000 > $APEI_IF/param2
    $ echo 1 > $APEI_IF/notrigger
    $ echo 1 > $APEI_IF/error_inject

* Check the MCE statistic: mcelog --client. Check the mcelog log for injected error details: less /var/log/mcelog.

Additional useful plugins
--------------------------

Exec Plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~

Can be used to show you when notifications are being generated by calling a
bash script that dumps notifications to file. (handy for debug). Modify
/opt/collectd/etc/collectd.conf:

.. code:: bash

   LoadPlugin exec
   <Plugin exec>
   #   Exec "user:group" "/path/to/exec"
      NotificationExec "user" "<path to barometer>/barometer/src/collectd/collectd_sample_configs/write_notification.sh"
   </Plugin>

write_notification.sh (just writes the notification passed from exec through
STDIN to a file (/tmp/notifications)):

.. code:: bash

   #!/bin/bash
   rm -f /tmp/notifications
   while read x y
   do
     echo $x$y >> /tmp/notifications
   done

output to /tmp/notifications should look like:

.. code:: bash

    Severity:WARNING
    Time:1479991318.806
    Host:localhost
    Plugin:ovs_events
    PluginInstance:br-ex
    Type:gauge
    TypeInstance:link_status
    uuid:f2aafeec-fa98-4e76-aec5-18ae9fc74589

    linkstate of "br-ex" interface has been changed to "DOWN"

logfile plugin
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Can be used to log collectd activity. Modify /opt/collectd/etc/collectd.conf to
include:

.. code:: bash

    LoadPlugin logfile
    <Plugin logfile>
        LogLevel info
        File "/var/log/collectd.log"
