    Added a playbook to compare collectd 5 and collectd 6. The playbook uses
    existing ansible roles to build both collectd 5 and collectd 6 container
    images, creates a common configuration, then runs the containers and shows
    the outputs to let the user inspect the metrics and whether they match.
