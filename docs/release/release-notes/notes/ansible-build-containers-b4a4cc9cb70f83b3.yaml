    Added a playbook and role for building the collectd containers locally.
    This automates the actions described in the docker install guide. The
    ``barometer-collectd``, ``barometer-collectd-latest`` and the
    ``barometer-collectd-experimental`` containers are now easier to build
    locally. The ``barometer-collectd-6`` and
    ``barometer-collectd-experimental`` containers can also be built with
    arbirtary PRs applied, to aid in testing locally.
