    Added `unixsock <https://collectd.org/documentation/manpages/collectd-unixsock.5.shtml>`_
    plugin to one-click install, which allows the user to interact with collectd using the
    ``collectdctl`` command in the bar-collectd-* containers.
    The unixsock plugin is useful for debugging issues in collectd, and can
    be used to verify that metrics are being collected without having to
    create CSV files or log into the container.
