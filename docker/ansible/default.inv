# NOTE: for defining hosts both hostnames and IP addresses forms can be used
# however it is advised to keep it consistent over the file, especially if
# the same host is used by multiple containers
# e.g. if some host will be described by IP address at first('127.0.0.1')
# and at some place the same host will be called using its hostname
# ('localhost') then ansible will treat them as different entities and
# synchronization problems during parallel dependencies installation
# may occur)
